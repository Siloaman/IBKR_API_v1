Stop with ProtectionCopy Location
A Stop with Protection order combines the functionality of a stop limit order with a market with protection order. 
The order is set to trigger at a specified stop price. When the stop price is penetrated, the order is triggered as a 
market with protection order, which means that it will fill within a specified protected price range equal to the 
trigger price +/- the exchange-defined protection point range. Any portion of the order that does not fill within this 
protected range is submitted as a limit order at the exchange-defined trigger price +/- the protection points.
