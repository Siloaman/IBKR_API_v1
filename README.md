1000 shares at $1.00
goes up by 10%
sell 30% of shares (300)
now own 700 share and $330

shares go back down to 0% -> sell all ($700 + $330 = $1030 or +3%)
shares go up to +30% (sell all ($910 + $330 = $1240 or +24%)

I want at least +$100 per trade, therefore from $10000 upwards all trades are a maximum of 1/10 of total equity value
Below that with a starting value of $2000 we can aim for 1/4 of total equity value
