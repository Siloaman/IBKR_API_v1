* ROYALTIES FOR EMPLOYEES!! https://www.realtor.ca/on/toronto/businesses-for-sale

* have accounts set up for friends that built up to 20K USD, then make successful trades once a month. if it hits +10% (~5500 cad) then send the money directly to their chequing account and cease trades for the rest of the month so that the rest of the days belong to me without competition)

mimimum price variation of 0.0001

when a person has reached +$40,000 USD, stop investing?

track limit orders placed with coded bids<br/>     
(<br/>    
    0.0144 = track all day<br/> 
    0.0155 = PAS<br/>
    0.0164 = Insta-Buy Quarter Equity (market)<br/>
    0.0162 = Insta-Buy Half Equity (market)<br/>
    0.0161 = Insta-Buy Full Equity (market)<br/>
)<br/> 
move SL based on thresholds throughout the day...

Buy in should be 7/6 stop to 8/6 limit... (just under R-35 of the next bar if its similar sized)

1000 shares at $1.00
goes up by 10%
sell 30% of shares (300)
now own 700 share and $330

shares go back down to 0% -> sell all ($700 + $330 = $1030 or +3%)
shares go up to +30% (sell all ($910 + $330 = $1240 or +24%)

I want at least +$100 per trade, therefore from $10000 upwards all trades are a maximum of 1/10 of total equity value
Below that with a starting value of $2000 we can aim for 1/4 of total equity value
